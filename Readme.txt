Designed and implemented a data collection program in Python utilizing the tweepy library to extract the latest 200 tweets from Elon Musk's Twitter account. The tweets were stored as a list of dictionaries, which were then converted into a Pandas DataFrame and saved as a CSV file. The project involved utilizing the Twitter API to authenticate and retrieve the tweets, as well as parsing the JSON data and extracting relevant information such as the text of the tweet, number of favorites, number of retweets, and date of creation.
